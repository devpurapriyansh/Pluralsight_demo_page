#Project-2
This is a Login Page of Puralsight. I made this wiih the help of HTML-5 amd CSS-3. I have used the Flexbox technique of the CSS to style this webpage. For making this I took the referencce of a YouTube video of Traversy Media. I edited the website according to my taste and thinking.

The entire code is written in HTML and CSS and the web page is made completely responsive using media queries. I have also used some copyright free images form Pixabay.com and Unsplash.com

This is a clone of the SignIn page (Welcome Page) of the Pluralsignt website It took me 3 - 4 hrs. to create the entire project. It was fun coding and I also got to learn so much from this project.
